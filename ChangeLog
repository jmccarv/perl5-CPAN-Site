=== version history for CPAN::Site

Wishlist:
 - install by distribution name/version not only package/version
   However... it's not the way CPAN works on the moment.
   See the CPAN6 development at http://cpan6.org

version 0.20: Thu Apr 10 12:13:26 CEST 2008
	- accept version objects [Alex Efros]
	- no warning "undef" when archive location is not specified
	- 01mailrc and 03modlist are updated from the real CPAN, not
	  just empty.  Motivated by contributions by [Alex Efros]
	- create directory trees when missing.  Only the top-level
	  must exist, to protect against errors.
	- Makefile.PL query about role not used [Alex Efros]
	- "Cpansite for the impatient" documentation by [Ales Efros]

version 0.19: Fri Mar 21 08:13:19 CET 2008
	- fix in distname [Matisse Enzer]

version 0.18: Wed Mar 19 18:35:37 CET 2008
	- cpansite script should strip file: with two slashes or none,
	  to permit absolute path.
	- fix when local archive is empty
	- only take pm's from lib- and top-dir, not f.i. from the
	  test-scripts [Matisse Enzer]

version 0.17: Wed Jan 30 16:44:07 CET 2008
	- fix for open file error [Matisse Enzer]
	- different way of defining the README output filename [Matisse Enzer]
	- minor output improvements. [Matisse Enzer]

version 0.16: Fri Nov  9 23:38:10 CET 2007
	- use package directory explicitly in the creation of the
	  readme extract. [Matisse Enzer]

version 0.15: Fri Jun  8 17:01:30 CEST 2007
	- document how to change urllist from CPAN.pm shell [Abe Timmerman]
	- removed short filename-support (MSDOS) from CPAN::Site
	- use empty 03modlist.data.gz
	- add t/pod.t

version 0.14: Tue Dec 19 13:42:48 CET 2006
	- use oodist (from OODoc) to produce manual pages
	- official new maintainer MARKOV
	- first public release of rewrite.

version 0.13:
	- depend on HTTP::Date if server
	- index generation code moved from bin/cpansite into
	  lib/CPAN/Site/Index.pm
	- Add CPANSITE_ROLE environment variable to Makefile.PL
	- show version of cpansite when shell is started

version 0.12:
	- 01mailrc is removed when the core cpan is merged in, and
	  created otherwise.

version 0.11:
	- use HTTP::Date to produce timestamp on package

version 0.10:
	- use functions
	- variables in CAPS are reserved for Perl
	- %VERSION and %PATH combined in %pkgs, which contains
	  [$version,$path] entries
	- only install details file after success
	- command-line option parsing
	- trace to STDOUT, new option verbose
	- CPAN::Site is very useful, and therefore don't call it ALPHA
	- regex to find version now accepts "our"
	- renamed mkpackages to 'cpansite index'
	- cpansite also can start shell and install modules
	- do not ask for URL at installation, because different people
	  may want different local archives: use environment variable
	  CPANSITE.
	- moved Site.pm to lib/CPAN

2006-03-19  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages: applied patch from Matisse Enzer so that it uses
	CPAN::Checksums to generate the CHECKSUMS files.  This probably
	renders it useless for ancient per installations.  Even my debian
	Perl 5.8 requires me to fetch these:

	      Compress-Bzip2-2.09
	      Compress-Zlib-1.41
	      Data-Compare-0.13
	      Text-Glob-0.06
	      Number-Compare-0.01
	      File-Find-Rule-0.28
	      Digest-SHA-5.34
	      CPAN-Checksums-1.039
       
	So fall back to the last version if that is too much hassle for
	you.  I may think about a fall back mode if CPAN::Checksums is not
	available.

2005-09-18  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Integrated patch from Matisse Enzer to generate .readme files.
	* Switching from MD5 to Digest::MD5
	* Gzip now called with the local file name $_.  $File::Find::name
	should not have worked?

1999-07-26  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* Site.pm: Added CPAN::Config->load call which is required by
	newer CPAN.pm

Wed May  6 13:26:13 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages: Rudimentary CHECKSUMS support

Tue May  5 12:40:27 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages (wanted): 'package' now found even if in the first
 	line of a file.

Tue Mar  3 12:45:42 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages (wanted): $VERSION is found now even if line crosses 
	  block boundary.

Tue Jan 13 11:58:31 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* mkpackages: Now removes 'id/' from path

Thu Jan  8 12:26:42 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Makefile.PL: Ask for default URL

Wed Jan  7 20:15:54 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* mkpackages (wanted): now parses tar files to extract package
 	names and version
