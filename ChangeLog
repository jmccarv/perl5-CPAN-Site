=== version history for CPAN::Site

WISH: install by distribution name/version not only package/version

version 0.14: Tue Dec 19 13:42:48 CET 2006
	- use oodist (from OODoc) to produce manual pages
	- official new maintainer MARKOV
	- first public release of rewrite.

version 0.13:
	- depend on HTTP::Date if server
	- index generation code moved from bin/cpansite into
	  lib/CPAN/Site/Index.pm
	- Add CPANSITE_ROLE environment variable to Makefile.PL
	- show version of cpansite when shell is started

version 0.12:
	- 01mailrc is removed when the core cpan is merged in, and
	  created otherwise.

version 0.11:
	- use HTTP::Date to produce timestamp on package

version 0.10:
	- use functions
	- variables in CAPS are reserved for Perl
	- %VERSION and %PATH combined in %pkgs, which contains
	  [$version,$path] entries
	- only install details file after success
	- command-line option parsing
	- trace to STDOUT, new option verbose
	- CPAN::Site is very useful, and therefore don't call it ALPHA
	- regex to find version now accepts "our"
	- renamed mkpackages to 'cpansite index'
	- cpansite also can start shell and install modules
	- do not ask for URL at installation, because different people
	  may want different local archives: use environment variable
	  CPANSITE.
	- moved Site.pm to lib/CPAN

	* mkpackages: applied patch from Matisse Enzer so that it uses
	CPAN::Checksums to generate the CHECKSUMS files.  This probably
	renders it useless for ancient per installations.  Even my debian
	Perl 5.8 requires me to fetch these:

	      Compress-Bzip2-2.09
	      Compress-Zlib-1.41
	      Data-Compare-0.13
	      Text-Glob-0.06
	      Number-Compare-0.01
	      File-Find-Rule-0.28
	      Digest-SHA-5.34
	      CPAN-Checksums-1.039
       
	So fall back to the last version if that is too much hassle for
	you.  I may think about a fall back mode if CPAN::Checksums is not
	available.

2005-09-18  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Integrated patch from Matisse Enzer to generate .readme files.
	* Switching from MD5 to Digest::MD5
	* Gzip now called with the local file name $_.  $File::Find::name
	should not have worked?

	* Site.pm: Added CPAN::Config->load call which is required by
	newer CPAN.pm

Wed May  6 13:26:13 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>
