## Contributing

When you want to contribute to this module, you do not need to provide
a perfect patch... actually: it is nearly impossible to create a patch
which I will merge without modification.  Usually, I need to adapt the
style of code and documentation to my own strict rules.

When you submit an extension, please contribute a set with

1. code

2. code documentation

3. regression tests in t/
